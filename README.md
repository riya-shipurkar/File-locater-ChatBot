Project Tite: File locater chatbot
Description: File locater Chatbot is a simple and efficient Python-based chatbot that helps users locate files within their computerâ€™s file explorer. By interacting with the chatbot, users can search for files by keywords, making it easier to find and access specific files quickly. The chatbot simplifies the file search process without the need to navigate through folders manually, improving productivity and ease of access to files.
Installation: Use Pycharm or any Python IDE. 
Usage: The chatbot will prompt you to enter specific directory. Then it will ask you the type of file you are looking for (e.g. pdf, word doc). Then it will ask you to enter a keyword that is in the filename (e.g. ABC'S 2024 resume - you can enter either ABC, 2024, or resume).
